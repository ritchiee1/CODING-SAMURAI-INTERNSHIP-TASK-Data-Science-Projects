## üìå Projects Overview

### 1. Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and preprocessed passenger dataset.  
- Performed exploratory analysis to identify patterns affecting survival.  
- Visualized correlations using heatmaps, histograms, and bar plots.  
- Extracted insights into demographic and socioeconomic survival factors.  

### 2. Titanic Logistic Regression Survival Predictions
- Built a **Logistic Regression model** to classify passenger survival.  
- Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  
- Showed practical classification problem-solving with structured data.  

### 3. Time Series Forecasting on Apple Stock Prices
- Collected Apple stock price data using `yfinance`.  
- Conducted trend and seasonality analysis.  
- Implemented **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** for forecasting.  
- Visualized future stock predictions with confidence intervals.  

### 4. Retail Analytics for Rossmann Stores using Linear Regression
- Applied **Linear Regression** to predict sales trends.  
- Analyzed relationships between dependent and independent variables.  
- Evaluated performance using R¬≤ and error metrics (MAE, RMSE).  
- Demonstrated regression modeling for business forecasting use cases.
