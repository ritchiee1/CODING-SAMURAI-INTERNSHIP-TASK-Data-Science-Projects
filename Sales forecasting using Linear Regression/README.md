## 🎯 Project Scope
This project focuses on predicting **daily sales** of Rossmann Stores using a **Linear Regression model** with polynomial features. The aim is to analyze factors affecting sales performance and provide data-driven insights for business strategy.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess the Rossmann sales dataset.  
- Explore features and relationships through **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.  
- Build and train a **Linear Regression model**.  
- Evaluate the model using **R², RMSE, and MAE**.  
- Generate insights and recommendations for sales optimization.  

---

## 📌 Expected Outcome
- A trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting store sales.  
- Business insights on the effect of customers, promotions, and seasonal factors.  
- Recommendations on how promotions and customer behavior influence revenue.  

---

## 📖 Document Purpose
This documentation provides a clear overview of the project workflow, methodology, insights, and recommendations. It serves as both a **technical reference** for developers and a **business report** for decision-makers.  

---

## 🏪 Use Case
Rossmann Stores can use this model to:  
- Forecast future sales.  
- Plan effective **promotional campaigns**.  
- Allocate resources (staffing, inventory) based on predicted demand.  
- Understand **seasonality and customer behavior** patterns.  

---

## 📊 Data Source
The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle – Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).  
- **Features:** Store, DayOfWeek, Date, Sales, Customers, Open, Promo, StateHoliday, SchoolHoliday.  
- **Target:** Sales (continuous variable).  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Processing
- Converted `Date` column into **Year, Month, Day**.  
- Encoded categorical variables (`StateHoliday`).  
- Handled scaling and applied **polynomial feature transformation (degree=3)**.  
- Split dataset into **train (80%) and test (20%)** subsets.  

---

## 🔍 Data Analysis
- Sales distribution showed **left skewness** with notable outliers.  
- **Customers** strongly correlate with sales, making it the most influential feature.  
- **Promotions** significantly boost sales compared to non-promo days.  
- Seasonal patterns observed across **Months, Days, and Years**.  

---

## 📈 Data Visualization
- Distribution plots for Sales.  
- Average sales trends by **Month, Day, Year**.  
- Comparison of **Promo vs. Non-Promo sales**.  
- Scatter plot showing correlation between **Customers and Sales**.  
- Correlation heatmap of features.  

---

## 💡 Recommendation
- Increase **promotional activities** during low-sales months to balance demand.  
- Use customer traffic data as a **key indicator** for predicting store performance.  
- Combine sales data with **external factors** (competitors, weather, local events) for more robust forecasting.  
- Regularly retrain models to adapt to **changing sales patterns**.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The Linear Regression model with polynomial features achieved strong performance:  
- **RMSE:** 1362.12  
- **MAE:** 914.59  
- **R²:** 0.87  

This indicates that the model explains **87% of sales variance**, making it a reliable baseline model for sales prediction. Future work may involve advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Time Series) to further improve forecasting accuracy.
