[Conclusion](#conclusion)  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🎯 Project Scope\n","This project focuses on predicting **daily sales** of Rossmann Stores using a **Linear Regression model** with polynomial features. The aim is to analyze factors affecting sales performance and provide data-driven insights for business strategy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🎯 Project Objectives\n","- Collect and preprocess the Rossmann sales dataset.  \n","- Explore features and relationships through **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.  \n","- Build and train a **Linear Regression model**.  \n","- Evaluate the model using **R², RMSE, and MAE**.  \n","- Generate insights and recommendations for sales optimization.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 📌 Expected Outcome\n","- A trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting store sales.  \n","- Business insights on the effect of customers, promotions, and seasonal factors.  \n","- Recommendations on how promotions and customer behavior influence revenue.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 📖 Document Purpose\n","This documentation provides a clear overview of the project workflow, methodology, insights, and recommendations. It serves as both a **technical reference** for developers and a **business report** for decision-makers.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🏪 Use Case\n","Rossmann Stores can use this model to:  \n","- Forecast future sales.  \n","- Plan effective **promotional campaigns**.  \n","- Allocate resources (staffing, inventory) based on predicted demand.  \n","- Understand **seasonality and customer behavior** patterns.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 📊 Data Source\n","The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle – Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).  \n","- **Features:** Store, DayOfWeek, Date, Sales, Customers, Open, Promo, StateHoliday, SchoolHoliday.  \n","- **Target:** Sales (continuous variable).  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Processing\n","- Converted `Date` column into **Year, Month, Day**.  \n","- Encoded categorical variables (`StateHoliday`).  \n","- Handled scaling and applied **polynomial feature transformation (degree=3)**.  \n","- Split dataset into **train (80%) and test (20%)** subsets.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🔍 Data Analysis\n","- Sales distribution showed **left skewness** with notable outliers.  \n","- **Customers** strongly correlate with sales, making it the most influential feature.  \n","- **Promotions** significantly boost sales compared to non-promo days.  \n","- Seasonal patterns observed across **Months, Days, and Years**.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 📈 Data Visualization\n","- Distribution plots for Sales.  \n","- Average sales trends by **Month, Day, Year**.  \n","- Comparison of **Promo vs. Non-Promo sales**.  \n","- Scatter plot showing correlation between **Customers and Sales**.  \n","- Correlation heatmap of features.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 💡 Recommendation\n","- Increase **promotional activities** during low-sales months to balance demand.  \n","- Use customer traffic data as a **key indicator** for predicting store performance.  \n","- Combine sales data with **external factors** (competitors, weather, local events) for more robust forecasting.  \n","- Regularly retrain models to adapt to **changing sales patterns**.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## ✅ Conclusion\n","The Linear Regression model with polynomial features achieved strong performance:  \n","- **RMSE:** 1362.12  \n","- **MAE:** 914.59  \n","- **R²:** 0.87  \n","\n","This indicates that the model explains **87% of sales variance**, making it a reliable baseline model for sales prediction. Future work may involve advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Time Series) to further improve forecasting accuracy.  "],"metadata":{"id":"0lpMTBnNJ2Ef"}}]}
